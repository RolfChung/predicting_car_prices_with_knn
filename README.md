# predicting_car_prices_with_knn
Summary

This project applies the k-nearest neighbors algorithm on the automobile data set. The goal is to predict car prices from different set of features. It uses a complete scikit machine learning work including train-test-split, instantiating, fitting, predicting and evaluating the knn-model. The pandas package is use for data cleaning, imputing, and subsetting. Data visualization are provided on the way and so are different functions created. The considerations and predictions are given below.
